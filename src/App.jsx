// This project uses Material-UI to style components, MUI components are imported from @mui/material
// Custom styling for MUI components is done by adding a sx prop to the component

// MUI icons used for icons, these are imported from @mui/icons

// React router is used to route between components,  the routes are defined in the Routes component's children
// The 'Link' component, in the Nav component is used to link to other components, for the Router

// The cart state is stored in cart context, which the CartProvider then provides. 

// User login/logout state is handled in UserContext
// What user is currently logged in does not matter, the same cart is loaded as long as a user exists
// The cart and user is stored in local storage. This is done in the useEffect(), in the WebShopStorage component

// The products and their information are defined in the ProductsContext
// These are used by the Shop component to display the products with the Product component

// React spring is installed as a dependency, but is not currently used. 
// Spring will be used in the future to animate various components.
